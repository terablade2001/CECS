# HOW TO USE C++ Version
In order to use the C++ version, client can copy the CECS.c file from C 
version to a new file CECSc.cpp, and use that file instead together with 
CECS.cpp file. The CECSc.cpp is the normal CECS library in C, but compiled 
with C++, and the CECS.cpp is the extension of the CECS library to C++ using 
classes for better organization.

The file CECS.h from C Version should be copied to the same folder of CECS.hpp.
